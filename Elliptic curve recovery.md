If an attacker has access to a history of intermediate elliptic curve point coordinates, recovering the private key could be challenging but not necessarily impossible. The feasibility of such an attack depends on several factors:

1. **Details of the Intermediate Points**: If the attacker has detailed information about intermediate elliptic curve points during key generation or signing operations, it might provide clues about the private key. For instance, if the points are related to the signing process, the attacker might be able to use them to perform certain types of cryptanalytic attacks, such as the **"fault analysis"** or **"side-channel attacks"**.

2. **Type of Attack**: Different attacks have different requirements:

	- **Side-Channel Attacks**: These involve capturing data from the physical implementation of the cryptographic algorithm (e.g., timing information, power consumption). If the intermediate points are related to these measurements, they might help in recovering the private key.
	- **Fault Injection Attacks**: Injecting faults into the computation might cause erroneous intermediate values that can be analyzed to recover the key.
	- **Mathematical Attacks**: In some cases, if an attacker has a lot of intermediate points, they might use advanced mathematical techniques to deduce the private key.
	  
	  3. **Point Information and Security Parameters**: The security of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) relies on the difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems (like the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem). The attacker's ability to recover the private key depends on the strength of these problems and how much information they have. A large number of intermediate points might help in analyzing the structure of the problem but does not guarantee an easy path to the private key.
	  
	  4. **Implementation Details**: The specifics of how the elliptic curve algorithm is implemented can also influence vulnerability. Poor implementation choices, such as not securely handling intermediate values or using weak random number generators, might expose the system to risks.
	  
	  In general, ECC is considered secure against direct attacks as long as proper practices are followed. However, if the intermediate points reveal patterns or weaknesses due to poor implementation or side-channel leaks, there's a potential risk, though it's typically difficult and requires sophisticated techniques. To minimize such risks, it is crucial to use well-reviewed libraries and follow best practices for cryptographic implementations.
